You're importing a component that needs useState. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked 
with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.

 1 | import { useState } from 'react';
   :          ^^^^^^^^
 2 | import Header from "./components/Header";
 3 | import Section from "./components/Section";
 4 | import Footer from "./components/Footer";

Maybe one of these should be marked as a client entry with "use client":
  ./app\page.js
