## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

1. As React.js is an improvement on JavaScript, I fully got to understand why Next.js is an improvement on React.js. I'm now a firm believer!  
2. Got to use "place-content: center"; CSS property. I understand it's a shorthand property that combines the align-content and justify-content properties. 
3. Introduced to the concept and benefits of storing text in markdown files rather than in JavaScript files. 

### Continued development

More Next.js projects. GraphQL projects too in the longer term.
